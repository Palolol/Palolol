# Portfolio Rewrite — Change Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to `src/App.vue` to rebrand the portfolio from a "Game Developer / Creative Coder / Freelancer" identity to a **college student AI/ML developer** identity. The rewrite removes all game-development / freelancer / "ideas left" framing and replaces it with a narrative about academic work (Tomato Diagnosis Expert System, Mobile Food Delivery university project) and current self-initiated AI model building on a laptop.

## Files Touched
- `src/App.vue` — only file modified

## Identity Pivot
**Before:** Game Developer & Creative Coder — Making worlds, one pixel at a time. Freelance game developer with 3+ years of experience, games made, and infinite ideas.

**After:** College student studying computer science / AI. Has built a Tomato Diagnosis Expert System (academic project), developed a Mobile Food Delivery app (university project), and is currently building AI/ML models on a personal laptop.

# Second Pass — Frieren Virtual Teacher Video Avatar

## Overview
Replaced the static anime-teacher image and the long typed-out story in the home section's "First Project" card with a **looping local video** (`frieren.gif.mp4`) that does the explaining. Frieren is the anime teacher — the video is the avatar, and a short, single-line caption introduces the developer's first project. The video autoplays, loops, and is muted so the user doesn't have to interact with it.

## Files Touched
- `src/assets/frieren.gif.mp4` — moved from repo root → `public/` → `src/assets/`. Living in `src/assets/` lets Vite bundle it with the correct `base` path for GitHub Pages.
- `src/App.vue` — template, script, and style for the first-project card
- `document.md` — this section

## Specific Changes

### 1. Asset location
- **Original:** `frieren.gif.mp4` at the repo root (not served by Vite at all).
- **First move:** `public/frieren.gif.mp4` — Vite serves `public/*` at the site root, so the path worked locally but **broke on GitHub Pages** because the site is served from `/Palolol/` (Vite `base: "/Palolol/"`) and `/frieren.gif.mp4` resolved to `palolol.github.io/frieren.gif.mp4` (404).
- **Final move:** `src/assets/frieren.gif.mp4`, imported in the script as:
  ```js
  import animeTeacherUrl from "./assets/frieren.gif.mp4";
  ```
  Vite hashes the filename and rewrites the path with the configured `base`, so the deployed URL becomes `palolol.github.io/Palolol/assets/frieren-XXXX.mp4`.

### 2. `first-project-card` content
- **Avatar:** `<img>` was replaced with a `<video>` element bound to `animeTeacherUrl`. The video is `autoplay`, `muted`, `loop`, and `playsinline` so it starts immediately, repeats forever, and works on mobile.
- **Bubble copy:** The long, character-by-character typed story was removed. Replaced with a **single short line** that introduces the developer's first project — the video itself does the "explaining" visually:
  > "My first project? A tiny Python calculator. From one script to expert systems, mobile apps, and AI models — every developer starts with a single line."
- **Replay button:** Removed (no longer needed — the video loops on its own).

### 3. Script logic
- **Removed:** `typedStory`, `firstProjectStory`, `startTyping`, `replayStory`, typing timer, and the `onMounted(() => startTyping())` call.
- **Removed:** `onAvatarError` (no `<img>` left in the template).
- **Replaced:** the static `const animeTeacherUrl = "/frieren.gif.mp4"` with `import animeTeacherUrl from "./assets/frieren.gif.mp4"`. The import is a top-level statement (must appear above any code that uses it).

### 4. CSS
- **Kept:** the outer card layout, the avatar slot, the glow + tag, the speech bubble, the bubble tail, the entrance animation, and the responsive mobile override.
- **Updated:** `.first-project-avatar img` rule renamed to `.first-project-avatar video` so the video fills the round slot the same way the image did.
- **Removed:** the typing-caret and replay-button styles (no longer used).

## Implementation Notes
- The video is imported via Vite's asset handling, so the final URL is rewritten with the configured `base` (here `/Palolol/`). This is what fixes the GitHub-Pages deployment.
- `muted` is required for `autoplay` to work in all modern browsers (Chrome/Safari/Firefox autoplay policy).
- `playsinline` prevents iOS Safari from forcing fullscreen on autoplay.
- If the video file ever fails to load, the round slot still shows the blue gradient background (the `<video>` element's CSS background), so the page never looks broken.

## Third Pass — GitHub Pages Base Path Fix

### The bug
First-pass deployment to GitHub Pages showed the home first-project card and the portfolio hero `port-avatar` as **empty circles** with no video. The page loaded fine; only the video was missing.

### Root cause
Vite was configured with `base: "/Palolol/"` (required so the deployed bundle loads assets from `/Palolol/...` instead of `/...`). But `animeTeacherUrl` was hard-coded to `"/frieren.gif.mp4"`. At build time, Vite copies the file from `public/` to the site root as `frieren.gif.mp4`, but the runtime URL is **not** rewritten through `base`. So the browser requested `https://palolol.github.io/frieren.gif.mp4` → 404 → no video.

### The fix
Move the asset out of `public/` (which Vite copies verbatim with no path rewriting) and into `src/assets/` (which Vite imports as a module). Imported asset URLs go through Vite's path-rewriting pipeline, so the final deployed URL becomes `https://palolol.github.io/Palolol/assets/frieren-[hash].mp4` — the correct location for the site.

### Files changed
- `src/assets/frieren.gif.mp4` — moved from `public/`.
- `src/App.vue` — added `import animeTeacherUrl from "./assets/frieren.gif.mp4"`; removed the hard-coded string.

## Fourth Pass — Email Update

### What changed
- Replaced the placeholder email `palolol@email.com` with the real address `palolol1165@gmail.com`.
- Touched in 4 places in `src/App.vue` (all were the same string, replaced with `replace_all`):
  1. Navbar "Hire Me" button `href`
  2. Mobile menu "Hire Me" button `href`
  3. Contact card "Send a message" button `href`
  4. Contact card ghost label text
- No CSS, structure, or copy changes — just the email.

## Fifth Pass — Telegram Contact Link

### What changed
Added `https://t.me/palolol` as a second contact channel so visitors can message you on Telegram in addition to email.

- **Navbar (desktop):** new ghost-style "✈️ Telegram" link placed before the "Hire Me" CTA, so it's visible on every page.
- **Mobile menu:** "✈️ Message on Telegram" link, full width, below the "Hire Me" CTA.
- **Contact card (portfolio section):** new "💬 Telegram" outline button (Telegram-blue border) sitting next to the "Send a message" email button.

### Telegram URL note
Telegram `t.me/` URLs do not include the `@` symbol in the path — the `@` is only used as a display prefix inside the app. So `@palolol` becomes `https://t.me/palolol`. The link opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`) so the user doesn't lose the portfolio.

### CSS additions
- `.nav-tg` — ghost-style navbar link (subtle border, soft hover with the brand-blue tint)
- `.nav-tg.mobile-tg` — full-width mobile variant
- `.btn-telegram` / `.btn-telegram:hover` — outline button using Telegram's brand blue `#2aabee`

## Sixth Pass — Stats Update

### What changed
Two stats in the portfolio hero row were adjusted to be more honest about where the developer is right now:
- **Projects:** `12` → `5+`
- **Models Trained:** `06` → `1`

The "Years Exp: 3+" and "Research Focus: AI/ML" cards were left unchanged.
